# Introduction

While there are many interesting problems to solve in our emerging decentralized ecosystem, there is one that seems to plague every project, especially as it breaks past the initial stage of finding its first product/market fit: How to attract, evaluate, and retain valuable talent to execute on the growing list of tasks and ideas that accrue over time?

(Note: Going forward I will use term 'buidlers' which I mean to be anyone putting in 'sweat equity' to projects, including developers/marketers/community managers/translators, etc.)

I believe, with the initial success of a number of projects as well as the increasing velocity of the bull market, that the market for valuable buidlers is about to become extremely competitive in the short term, paired with a large number of the most experienced buidlers in the space becoming wealthy, themselves.  This is going to create an opportunity to build a mindshare moat for those projects which can adopt the proper incentives to attract this talent and reward them for their participation. 

Synthetix has always spearheaded the charge to experiment with incentive models to motivate important participants in their platform, and I believe the gDAO is a perfect way for us to expand this tradition to include buidlers.  My hope is that we can leverage our public funding efforts to create a positive flywheel of Spartan-buidlers, with both sides sharing in the prosperity resulting therefrom.

# Epoch Themes

For the first epoch, a lot of foundational work will need to be done, which will reshape how the gDAO works as an operating group.  On top of that, I would also like to try and push for some retroactive and community-based grants, as we will not launch with an initial pipeline of proposals.

## Operational Development

As we are rebooting the gDAO for a fresh run, the bulk of the effort will need to be geared towards redefining how the gDAO operates.

**Epoch Goals TL;DR**

 - Establishing a formal council process for proposal review
 - Create a new draft of the proposal template
 - Establishing a process for tracking and validation of active grant milestones
 - Define communication channels/platforms for the council and grantees
 - Create a public-facing budget for accounting and transparency

### Establish Formal Proposal Process

Though it might seem obvious, the top priority should be to define and codify the process by which the council actually receives, debates, and ultimately passes judgement on all proposals.  Being prepared with our process helps set reliable expectations for potential buidlers.

Suggestions for discussion:
 - proposal decision cadence (guarantee council decisions being made within a certain timeframe)
 - scheduled Q&A session between council/proposer for draft feedback
 - very specific guidance from council for how funding should be structured (one of the biggest hangups to all applications)

### Draft New Proposal Template

Another big effort should be made around updating the [project proposal template](https://github.com/Synthetixio/snx-grants-dao/blob/master/proposals/proposal-template.md), it is very bare-bones and I believe if the council goes through the effort to really flesh it out, that it will provide a strong skeleton to structure our entire grants process.  It's also likely to one of the first documents that a potential grantee sees, so we should be treating it as part of our audition to bring them in.

### Establish Formal Grant-tracking Process

Though we will not have any projects to actively manage from the start, a new process needs to be established to check in with projects that have been given grants, and to validate delivery of milestones and/or adherence to maintenance agreements.

### Define Communication Patterns

Council should also dedicate some energy toward defining the proper channels for interaction within the process.

Some things I bucket here:
 - Outlining what/where/when things are discussed on Discord vs. other channels
 - collaboration tools for internal council project management
 - wiki or similar for collection of public facing help documentation
 - channel(s) for advertising requests for proposals on ideas we have backlogged

### Budget Creation

Proper accounting is imperative for the day to day operation of the DAO, as well as an important item to be transparent to our community.  Special effort should be given around creation and publication of a budget for the gDAO.


## Retroactive Grants

While we may not have an immediate influx of new grant proposals, I think that there is an opportunity to highlight a number of extraordinary efforts from community members in the recent months, and propose that the gDAO sets up nomination system and formal criteria to reward these efforts.

These are some examples I would nominate:
  - danijel for development and ongoing maintenance of the discord bots (not to mention tirelessly organizing the chess tournaments)
  - alexander for meme production on [@synthetixmemes](https://twitter.com/synthetixmemes)
  - kaleb for anti-frontrunning efforts
  - spreek for discord martyrdom


## Community Outreach

Community has huge value to projects, and gDAO can help build community through incentives for both internal and external buidlers.  I personally spend a lot of time on the SNX discord as well as following a number of other project discord communities, so while many gDAO members will have their own causes to champion, I would like to carry the standard for internal and external community-based initiatives.  

### Establish SNX Discord Improvement Incentives

There are many ways we can use introduce regular competitions and rewards for positive behaviour on our discord.

  - Bounties for helping users in certain high-value channels (i.e. #tech-support). distributed by message frequency or some other metric.
  - Regular content competitions (memes, emojis, infographics, videos, etc.)
  - Community-competition for directing Gitcoin donations

### Cross-community Collaboration

Many talented buidlers frequent other communities.  Collaborating with the Synthetix Ambassadors, we should outline opportunities where our interests align with external protocols, and can potentially combine efforts in funding/network as well as getting the opportunity to advertise our own available opportunities.

### Synthetix Hackathon

This will likely take longer than a single epoch to execute, but I would like to lay some foundation for a future gDAO-sponsored hackathon.  It could be good exposure for our system, as well as an opportunity to advertise our backlog of project ideas that we have built up.

The hackathon format should also align well with our public funding model, as it creates a competitive filter for project ideas and team execution, which we can translate into further development milestones, as desired.
